# WC3-HeroesAndEmpires2019
*By Halithor*

This is a remake project of the classic Heroes and Empires game from whenever ago in WC3 history. The game has been one of my personal favorites, but has many elements that could be improved on. There's also the issue with there being many hacked versions and nobody being totally sure which version to host.

The goals of this project are to recreate the Heroes and Empires experience but improve upon the gameplay of both Empire and Hero players. Empire systems will be more balanced and have more interesting dynamics in the systems used. Hero class and item systems will be almost entirely redone. The quests and global events will also be enhanced with more variety.
